# Spreadsheet UI Project

This is a React project where I built a spreadsheet-like UI based on a Figma design called "Intern Design Assignment." The goal was to make it look and feel as close as possible to the design with editable cells, colored status badges, and avatars.

## Live Demo

Check out the live version here:  
[https://hellobro12.github.io/spreadsheet-ui](https://hellobro12.github.io/spreadsheet-ui)

## What I Built

- A table with editable cells like a spreadsheet  
- Colored badges to show different status (like "In-process", "Complete", etc.)  
- User avatars shown in the table  
- A toolbar with buttons that log messages when clicked  
- Styled everything using Tailwind CSS to match the design  
- Used React and TypeScript for better coding practice

## Tech Stuff Used

- React 18 with Create React App  
- TypeScript in strict mode for safer code  
- Tailwind CSS for quick styling  
- react-icons for icons  
- Deployed on GitHub Pages

## How to Run It Locally

If you want to try it out on your machine, here’s how:

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hellobro12/spreadsheet-ui.git
   cd spreadsheet-ui
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

Things to Note
The spreadsheet looks like the Figma design but doesn’t have all features yet (like keyboard navigation or real-time updates)

Toolbar buttons just print messages in the console for now — they don’t do actual actions

Avatars and statuses are hardcoded for now — no backend or database.

This was mainly a front-end project focused on UI and interactivity.

Thanks for checking out my project! If you want to give feedback or suggest improvements, feel free to reach out.

About Me
I'm a recent college graduate starting my journey in front-end development. This project helped me practice building UIs with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
